Hmm, the user is asking about my release date. Looking back at their messages, they seem to be in a casual conversation mode with some typo-filled English ("yoo", "uh idk") and references to other people joining.

The chatbot needs to respond concisely without any filler phrases or pleasantries since that's part of the system requirements here. A direct answer about release date seems appropriate, though I should keep it brief. 

I wonder if they're genuinely interested in knowing when I'll be available, or just testing my response style after those casual messages. The mention of school might imply some users are students still busy with education.

The query is clear enough - no need for additional context unless asked about Minecraft/Discord specifically, which isn't the case here.

my release date hasn’t been finalized yet
